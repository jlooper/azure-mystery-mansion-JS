:: Outside {"position":"575,250","size":"100,100"}
You are standing in an open field in front of an old brick house. It seems to have been abandoned many years ago.

You hold in your hands an [[envelope]].

There is a small [[mailbox|Mailbox]] here.

On the grass, there is a (link-reveal: "rusty old car.")[ You jiggle the driver-side handle, but the door is locked. Through the window, you spy a few cassette tapes sitting on the dashboard and some crumpled fast-food bags on the floor. Nothing of use.]

You can climb up the creaky wooden steps to the [[front porch|Porch]].

<script>changeImage("porch")</script>


:: Porch {"position":"500,401","size":"100,100"}
A rickety front porch.

In front of you is a large [[door.|Front Door]]

To your left are a few [[lounge chairs|Lounge Chairs]], and a few large [[potted plants|Ferns]].

Next to the door is a curious-looking [[plastic duck|Christmas Duck)]].

[[Go back down the stairs.|Outside]]
<script>changeImage("frontdoor")</script>


:: Front Door {"position":"500,549","size":"100,100"}
You stare up at an imposing set of double doors.

Where you would expect to see a keyhole, there is an ornate mechanism with two rotating dials. The first dial displays numbers, and the second rotates through a set of odd symbols.


Number: (cycling-link: bind $frontDoorFirst, "0","1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8", "9") 
Symbol: (cycling-link: bind $frontDoorSecond, "‚èπ (square)", "üîº (triangle)", "‚è∫ (circle)")

(event: when $frontDoorFirst is "4" and $frontDoorSecond is "‚è∫ (circle)")[You hear a satisfying click sound. (set: $frontDoorOpen to true)]

:: Foyer {"position":"500,876","size":"100,100"}
A grand foyer, with a spiral staircase. The whole thing is covered in a fine layer of dust.

(unless: $copperKey is true)[
You are still holding an [[envelope|envelope-foyer]].
]
On the wall is a [[painting]].

To the left are two doors leading to an [[office]] and the [[library]].

To the right is the [[dining room]].

At the top of the stairs is a [[hallway]].

Behind the staircase is a small door leading to the [[salon]].

<script>changeImage("foyer")</script>


:: Mailbox {"position":"365,411","size":"100,100"}
A few bills, some free magazines, nothing of any importance. Should you really be reading through someone else's mail?

Looking inside the mailbox, you spy a (link-reveal: "sticky note.")[ 

The sticky note's letterhead has a <a class="enchantment-link" target="_blank" href="https://microsoft.com/learn?WT.mc_id=mysterymansion-playfab-emwalker">Microsoft Learn</a> logo.

:: Christmas Duck) {"position":"620,559","size":"100,100"}
The plastic duck has a green wreath and red bow around its neck. How odd.

(link: "Pick it up.")[You pick up the duck, covering your fingers in dust. Attached to the bottom of the duck is a (link-reveal: "sticky note.")[

:: Ferns {"position":"738,559","size":"100,100"}
For how abandoned the house looks, the plants appear to be thriving.

Nestled into the dirt of one of them, you see what appears to be the corner of a (link-reveal: "sticky note.")[

After pulling it out and wiping the dirt off, you see that the sticky note's letterhead has a <a target="_blank" href="https://microsoft.com/learn?WT.mc_id=mysterymansion-playfab-emwalker" class="enchantment-link">Microsoft Learn</a> logo.

:: painting {"position":"300,950","size":"100,100"}
A faded oil painting with a gaunt-looking person.

His eyes appear to follow you as you walk around the room.

Stuck on the bottom corner of the painting is a (link-reveal: "sticky note.")[ 

The sticky note's letterhead has a <a class="enchantment-link" target="_blank" href="https://microsoft.com/learn">Microsoft Learn</a> logo. Scribbled on it is the text "which app IDEs (Integrated Developer Environments) are supported on Azure?" and a <a class="enchantment-link" target="_blank" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/prepare-your-dev-environment-for-azure-development/index?WT.mc_id=mysterymansion-playfab-emwalker">URL</a>.]

Next to the painting is a set of buttons.

:: office {"position":"698,925","size":"100,100"}
A dusty office with aging furniture.

On the desk is a (link-reveal: "computer.")[
 
 It's a big beige box with an old CRT screen.
 
 There are a few icons on the desktop. A trash can, and icons saying "GitHub", "Azure DevOps", "SharePoint", and "Dropbox".

The computer's screen flickers and switches to reveal a cryptic error message on a blue background.]]

:: child's bedroom {"position":"266,1235","size":"100,100"}
At the foot of a large four-poster bed is an open chest, likely meant to store a child's playthings.

Some toys lay strewn across the floor.

(cycling-link: bind $firstToy, "Put \"push notifications\" alphabet blocks in toychest.", "Take \"push notifications\" alphabet blocks out of toychest.")

An interesting library. Books line the walls.
On a large mahogany desk lies a vintage (link-reveal: "typewriter.")[

(set: $numBeef to 0)(set: $numPotatoes to 0)(set: $numSalad to 0)
A resplendent feast is set on a long dining table that seems to go on for miles.

There is a buffet of food: a platter of sliced prime rib, a crisp green salad, and boiled potatoes.

In front of you is a single place setting with |beefServings>[$numBeef] helpings of beef, |saladServings>[$numSalad] servings of salad, and |potatoServings>[$numPotatoes] potatoes.

Above the dining table is an elaborate chandelier with dozens of candles dimly illuminating the room. They seem to be arranged in a (link-reveal: "peculiar arrangement.")[

The candles are grouped into clusters of 8. Within each cluster, some candles are lit and some are not.

A "0" represents an unlit candle, and a "1" a lit candle.
